Electric Jellyfish
------------------

This is an audio-visualizer written in processing.
This is for an assignment for IMD3901 - Design studio in the BIT program. I'm having fun with it.

It uses the minim library for the Java sound api. http://code.compartmental.net/tools/minim/

Currently it runs only with embedded files - but I will be implementing it as a screensaver/visualizer for media players. :)

Regarding MP3s:
I didn't include the mp3s in the repo for size/copyright reasons.

To get things working (and avoiding null pointer refs) you are required to add mp3 to the project under /Electric_Jellyfish/data/

Naming convention as it stands is song_i.mp3, "i" being 1-5.
