Electric Jellyfish

This is an audio-visualizer written in processing.
This is for an assignment for IMD3901 - Design studio in the BIT program. I'm having fun with it.

It uses the minim beat detection plugin for the Java sound api. http://code.compartmental.net/tools/minim/

Currently it runs only with embedded files - but I will be implementing it as a screensaver/visualizer for media players.
